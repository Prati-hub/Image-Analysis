# Image-Analysis
# Face Detection,Edge Detection and Counting no of objects in an image 
# This project was a component of my undergraduate university course, where I had the opportunity to delve into the application of computer vision techniques such as face detection, edge detection and object counting in images. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that helped me to gain hands-on experience in these techniques and develop my skills in image processing.

#This code snippet is written in python programming language. It is importing a number of modules, packages and libraries such as Tkinter, numpy, PIL, ImageTk, tkFileDialog, cv2 and tkMessageBox, and matplotlib. These libraries are used for GUI development, image processing, file selection, and displaying messages and plots. The code is likely to be part of a larger program that uses these imported libraries to perform some specific image processing tasks.
