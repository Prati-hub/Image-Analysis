# Image-Analysis
# Face Detection,Edge Detection and Counting no of objects in an image 
# This project was a component of my undergraduate university course, where I had the opportunity to delve into the application of computer vision techniques such as face detection, edge detection and object counting in images. It was a challenging and rewarding experience that helped me to gain hands-on experience in these techniques and develop my skills in image processing
